description: An absolutely beautiful project, Parallel! A cross-platform F2P, multiplayer trading-card game. I worked as a Senior Unity Engineer building core systems, mobile-friendly UI, and a smoother first-time player experience. I also helped integrate features like matchmaking and the in-game store, improved stability, and ran team learning sessions to share best practices.
